Last week, after a marathon investigation, we published State Capture: The case against Nedbank. It caused public outrage. The story exposed the big-four bank’s relationship with financial services firm Regiments Capital, a key enabler of state capture. The revelation that Nedbank had paid or promised to pay Regiments some R95-million – mostly a reward for introducing the bank to government business following a “highly confidential” commission agreement – was the fruit of months of painstaking research. We trawled through leaked emails, memos and spreadsheets, and engaged extensively with the bank. Today we republish the investigation in an ebook – an easy-on-the-eye magazine version you can download and save to read when and where you want. *Download the ebook State Capture: The case against Nedbank here (cellphone) and here (desktop/tablet).
