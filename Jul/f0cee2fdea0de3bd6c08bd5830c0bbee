The amaB team is delighted to announce that Rob Rose will be joining AmaBhungane. It is a measure of his commitment to investigative journalism that he is giving up a prestigious editorship to join a tiny non-profit that punches above its weight. Rob will add power to that punch. He is a gifted journalist and editor and is well placed to bolster amaBhungane and help us grow, following the departure of co-managing partner Stefaans Brümmer. Rob is the outgoing editor of the Financial Mail and the author of The Grand Scam: How Barry Tannenbaum Conned South Africa’s Business Elite and Steinheist: Markus Jooste, Steinhoff & SA’s biggest corporate fraud. After earning a law degree, Rob took on the financial fraud and corporate governance beats at the Business Day newspaper, before moving to the Financial Mail in 2007, where he exposed the Barry Tannenbaum ponzi scheme. Later at the Sunday Times, he investigated shady contracts awarded by Fifa as part of the 2010 World Cup, and in 2013, became editor of the Business Times, before moving back to the Financial Mail in 2015.  We demand accountability. Expect it of us too. See our 2020/21 management narrative report here and our audited financials here.  He is a three-time winner of the Sanlam Financial Journalist of the Year, won the Taco Kuiper award for investigative journalism for his work on Barry Tannenbaum, and in 2010, was awarded a Nieman fellowship to Harvard University in 2010. Rob is joining us as an associate managing partner, reporting to managing partner Sam Sole. AmaBhungane will retain one executive director for now (following Stefaans’s departure) but will embark on a process of assessing the best structure for the organisation as it grows. Board-approved processes and procedures for further senior appointments will be developed, which will take into account diversity, inclusion, expertise and skills in investigative journalism.
